You can use it to make chatbots, chat loggers, monitor your friends' activity programmatically and so on.

This project is still in its early stages and may not compiled if cloned directly. I still have to write a proper makefile and test it on different platforms.

Right now it should compile under MinGW on Windows, but I'm not assuring anything.
